## APPLICATIONS:
checkers - a full featured checkers application
chess - a full featured chess application
go - the go game, invented in China 5000 years ago, this is one of the oldest board games out there. Simply place pieces on the lines on the board.
desktop - the test case for the desktop application

wm - this application known as the "window manager" is the desktop environment, this will open up several windows in a single screen. 

## WINDOW MANAGER:
To get to the window manager merely select "wm" from the start screen. From here you can launch any of the applications within the same window by clicking the programs menu on the bottom left corner. Then you select inside of the treeview. The window manager does not work in Internet Explorer.

## WEB BROWSERS:
Firefox 2.0, Firefox 3.0, Firefox 3.5 - should be no problems
Opera 8.0 and Opera 9.0 - right clicking might be different, float model might also make some things look weird. Overall all applications should work well.
Opera 10.0 - works great, I recommend studying the keyboard interface because it works nice in Opera and because Opera isn't nice when it comes to right clicks.
Safari 4.0 - Everything seems to work correctly here
Google Chrome - No problems here as far as I have seen

Internet Explorer 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0 - Canvas doesn't work so applications will be very slow if they use any graphics and if they even work. The float model sucks so if you try viewing tictactoe or checkers in it you will basically have big random gaps in the tables which don't make much sense.
